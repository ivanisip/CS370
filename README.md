# Pirate Intelligent Agent

This project applies reinforcement learning to train an intelligent agent that navigates a grid environment to find treasure while avoiding obstacles. It demonstrates concepts from reinforcement learning, Q-learning, and value-based decision-making.

## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented a Q-learning algorithm to solve the Pirate Treasure Hunt problem. The base Jupyter Notebook provided the environment and structure. I added the Q-table logic, reward structure, epsilon-greedy exploration, and training loop. I also tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor, and number of episodes.

The final result was a trained agent that efficiently navigates to the treasure while avoiding penalties.

## Reflection

### How does this connect to computer science?

This project taught me how reinforcement learning fits into the broader field of computer science. Computer scientists solve real-world problems using logic, data, and algorithms. This project required building a solution that learns through trial and error and adapts based on feedback.

### How do I approach problems as a computer scientist?

I learned to break down the problem, test different approaches, experiment with parameters, and measure success through rewards and performance over time. Iteration, debugging, and analysis were key to improving the agent.

### What are my ethical responsibilities?

As a developer, I must build systems that are fair, safe, and transparent. AI agents must be tested to avoid harm or bias. I also have a responsibility to protect data, explain how systems work, and ensure they are used ethically by organizations and end users.
